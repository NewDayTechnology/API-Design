# Contributing to the standards

These are *living standards* - this means that there is the expectation that they will be adjusted over time to accomodate different cateogires of solutions and patterns in APIs that we decide to ratify as a group.

## Proposing Changes

To propose a modification to the standard, please create a **fork** of this repository, and make your changes in the fork.

Once you're happy with the literature (and of course, please feel free to consult other authors during the process of making your changes), you can open a **pull request** on the origianl repository.

We will discuss any contentious issues with the proposal in the pull request discussion, and once the discussion has concluded, either merge and ratify the modification, or close and reject it.

## Changes and corrections that do not modify the standard

There will inevitably be a series of changes that do not modify the standard - spelling errors, typos, modified grammar etc. Please feel free to open a PR to accomodate these changes. They will likely just be automatically accepted.
