# API Title Convention

When uploading to the developer portals, the titles of our APIs should adhere to the following standard for consistency.

A good title has:
- A user-friendly format ('what it does API')
- Alphabetic characters only (i.e. a-z A-Z allowed)
- Capitalized initial letter
- Spaces between words
- API (not 'api')

Titles must not contain:
- NewDay or partner names
- Version numbers
