# Document Publication Guidelines

Refer to the following process, once your API content is ready for review:

1. Upload your markdown and Open API files to the Github respository.
**Note**: The Github repository is under construction. The link will soon be updated here.

    1. Flag the Open API file (user guides) as `External` if you want the content to be published in the production environment of the Developer Portal site. Otherwise, mark it as `Internal` if you want the content to be published in the internal Developer Portal site.
    2. Create a separate branch and upload your files. Upload three folders:
         * **Introduction**: Contains the API overview information.
         * **API Reference**: Contains the Open API file.
         * **Integration**: Contains the API integration information.
2. Raise a pull request and assign @DebDutta171989 as a reviewer.
  
    **Note**: The content is reviewed as per the documentation guidelines.
3. Incorporate the comments.  
4. @DebDutta171989 approves the content.
5. Merge your branch with the **main** branch.
