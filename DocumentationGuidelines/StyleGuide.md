# Style Guide

The aim is to present technical information in a simple manner; it must present a consistent writing style.

To achieve this, we recommend you to refer to the following guidelines. However, there could be deviations when you might have to explain difficult concepts in a different way.

## Avoid Ambigous Language

*Avoid* words like _might_, _could_, and _would_.

Example:  

**Avoid**: An error _might_ occur, if you do not enter correct information.  

**Better**: The following error occurs, if you do not enter correct information.  

## Use Second Person

Use _you_ instead of using third person pronouns _they_ or _customers_.

Example:

**Avoid**: The customer must enter the previous address, if they have resided at the current address for less than 12 months.  

**Better**: You must enter the previous address, if you have resided at the current address for less than 12 months.

## Use British English

The company standard is to use British English.

Example:

Use *Authorisation* and **not** *Authorization*  

## Avoid Latin Phrases and Abbreviations

It can be difficult to understand latin phrases. Hence, it is recommended to use full form of words.

Example:

**Avoid**: e.g, i.e.  

**Better**: Example, that is

For **abbreviations**, when you are using it for the first time in your content, explain the term. From next time onwards, you can use the abbreviated form.

## Capitalisation

### Headings

Use sentence case.

Example:

***MultiQuote API in the Acquisition Workflow***

### API Parameters

Use the same capitalisation as displayed in the API request or response message.  

## Active versus Passive Voice

Use Active voice in all generic scenarios. However, there might be a few exceptional cases, when you have to use Passive voice.

Example:

**Avoid**: The customer has to enter correct credentials.

**Better**: You must enter correct credentials.

## Use of Words

Refrain using any words that may have a subtle indication of the following:

* **Hurts any religious sentiment**: Do not mention any religion when you are explaining any concept or citing an example.  
* **Gender specific pronouns**: Use _they_ instead of _he_ or _she_, if required.
* **Colloquial words**: Do not use any colloquial words that are not yet a part of the British English dictionary.

## Lists

When explaining multiple items, mention them either in bulleted or numbered lists.

### Unordered versus Ordered Lists

Use bullets when you are explaining multiple items that do not follow a specific sequence.

Example:

* Mango
* Banana
* Grapes

Use numbered lists when the items have a sequential order.

Example:

1. Log in to your account with your credentials.
2. Click the **My Profile** tab.
3. Check and edit your information, as required.

### Nesting inside List Items

Based on your requirement, you may include the following under a list (bulleted or numbered):

* Code blocks  
* Images
* Note/ALerts/Disclaimers  
* Second level bulleted or numbered list

Items within the nested list must align with the first character of the list item.

Example:

1. In Jira, raise a ticket in the backlog. Mention the following in the ticket:  
    * Summary
    * Description  
    * Acceptance criteria
2. Assign the reviewer.
3. Incorporate the comments.

### Punctuation

Missing or incorrect punctuation alter the meaning of your sentences. Consider the following:

* Add comma (`,`) in the following scenarios:  
  * When you are mentioning a number of items.

    Example:  Mango, apple, banana, and grapes.
  
  * When you mention the following:  
    * However
    * Hence
    * Therefore

  * When you want a short pause in your sentence:  

    Example:

    If it is raining, the school will finish early.

* Add semicolon (`;`) when you are writing a complete sentence and it is related to the previous sentence.

  Example:

  The weather is lovely; it is neither too sunny nor too windy.

* Add full stop (`.`) at the end of a complete sentence.

  Example:

  After the request is received, it takes about 5 seconds to return a response.
